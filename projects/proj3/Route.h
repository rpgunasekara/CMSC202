  // Desc: Used to destruct a strand of Route
  // Preconditions: There is an existing Route strand with at least
  //   one airport
  // Postconditions: Route is deallocated (including all
  //   dynamically allocated airports) to have no memory leaks!

  //   Hint: Special cases (first airport, last airport, middle airport)
  // Preconditions: Index must be less than the size of the route
  //   Cannot make route less than two airports. If the route has
  //   two or fewer airports, fails.
  // Postconditions: Name may be updated. Size is reduced.
  //   Route has one less airport.
