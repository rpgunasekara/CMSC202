  // Name: Navigator (string) - Overloaded Constructor
  // Desc: Creates a navigator object to manage routes
  // Preconditions:  Provided with a filename of airports to load
  // Postconditions: m_filename is populated with fileName
  Navigator(string fileName);
  // Name: Navigator (destructor)
  // Desc: Deallocates all dynamic aspects of a Navigator
  // Preconditions: There is an existing Navigator
  // Postconditions: All airports and routes are cleared
  ~Navigator();
  // Name: Start
  // Desc: Loads the file and calls the main menu
  // Preconditions: m_fileName is populated
  // Postconditions: All ports are loaded and the main menu runs
  void Start();
  // Name: DisplayAirports
  // Desc: Displays each airport in m_airports
  // Preconditions: At least one airport is in m_airports
  // Postconditions: Displays all airports.
  //  Uses overloaded << provided in Airport.h
  void DisplayAirports();
  // Name: ReadFile
  // Desc: Reads in a file that has data about each airport
  //   including code, name, city, country, degrees north and degrees west.
  //   Dynamically allocates airports and stores them in m_airports
  //   The vector can hold many airports.
  // Preconditions: Valid file name of airports
  // Postconditions: Dynamically allocates each airport
  //   and enters it into m_airports
  void ReadFile();
  // Name: InsertNewRoute
  // Desc: Dynamically allocates a new route with the user selecting
  //   each airport in the route. Each route can have a minimum of two
  //   airports. Will not allow a one airport route.
  //   Checks for min of two valid airports (1-40)
  //   Route named using Route's UpdateName.
  //   For example, Baltimore to Boston
  //   Once route is created, inserted into m_routes.
  // Preconditions: Populated m_routes
  // Postconditions: Inserts a new route into m_routes
  void InsertNewRoute();
  // Name: MainMenu
  // Desc: Displays the main menu and manages exiting
  // Preconditions: Populated m_airports
  // Postconditions: Exits when someone chooses 5
  void MainMenu();
  // Name: ChooseRoute
  // Desc: Allows user to choose a specific route to work with
  //   by displaying numbered list
  // Preconditions: Populated m_routes
  // Postconditions: Returns the index of the selected route minus 1
  int ChooseRoute();
  // Name: DisplayRoute
  // Desc: Using ChooseRoute, displays a numbered list of all routes.
  //    If no routes, indicates that there are no routes to display
  //    User selects a route from list to display
  //    Displays numbered list of each airport in route
  //    Displays total miles of a route using RouteDistance
  // Preconditions: Routes has more than one airport
  // Postconditions: Displays all airports in a route and
  //    the total miles of the route

  // Desc: Using ChooseRoute, displays a numbered list of all routes.
  //    User selects one of the routes to remove an airport from.
  //    Displays a numbered list of all airports in selected route.
  //    User selects airport to remove from list.
  //    Each route has a minimum of two airports (will not allow).
  //    Removes airport from route if more than two.
  //    If first or last airport removed,
  //    updates name of route using UpdateName
  // Preconditions: Route has more than one airport
  // Postconditions: Displays updated route with removed airport
  //    and new name

  // Desc: Calculates the total distance of a route
  //    Goes from airport 1 to airport 2 then airport 2 to airport 3
  //    and repeats for length of route.
  //    Calculates the distance using CalcDistance (provided)
  //    Aggregates the total and returns the total in miles
  // Preconditions: Populated route with more than one airport
  // Postconditions: Returns the total miles between all airports in a route

  // Name: ReverseRoute
  // Desc: Using ChooseRoute, users chooses route and the route is reversed
  //   If no routes in m_routes, indicates no routes available to reverse
  //   Updates route name using UpdateName
  //   For example, Baltimore to Boston becomes Boston to Baltimore
  // Preconditions: Populated m_routes
  // Postconditions: Reverses a specific route by reversing the airports
  //   in place. Must move airports, cannot just change data in airports.

  //  their coordinates
  //  Takes in airport1 latitude (North), Airport1 Longitude (West)
  //  Takes in airport2 latitude (North), Airport2 longitude (West)
  // Preconditions: Requires two airports with their N (in degrees)
  //  and W (in degrees)
  // Postconditions: Returns distance in miles between two airports
